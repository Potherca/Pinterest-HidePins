# Hide Unwanted Pins on Pinterest

## Introduction

[Pinterest][pinterest] is a great resource to discover new and wonderful things 
or gain inspiration throught the day. Sadly, there are also a lot of things on 
Pinterest we could do without. Although there is a search function, there is no 
filter option. 

So I decided to create something that would hide all unwanted pins based on one 
or more words provided by a user.
